1. display current fps
2. abstract the spatial hash into a reusable class
3. implement surface tension
4. send particle specific data to the fragment shader (for visualizaton)
5. control when the simualtion starts
6. hot reloading settings/variable changes
7. why does visual studio compiler try to compile/access a deleted file (Kernels.cpp)
8. faster neighbor search ** (not sure it was faster)
9. flatten the force calculation loops make them fewer
10. in the get pressure function use max instead of min
11. call interact mouse with neighborhood particles instead of running it for all the particles
12. use a pointer store to reference particle neighbors, instead of computing them twice in a single simulation run
13. are very fast moving particles the cause of the performance dipping?
14. display the time taken for a frame:
    - Measurement
        - glfwGetTime()
    - Display
